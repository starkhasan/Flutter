        "question": "What is the difference Between isolation and quarantine?",
        "answer": "Quarantine is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the Corona virus, whether the infected person has symptoms or not.Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days.\n\nIsolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care."

        "question": "How does a vaccine work?",
        "answer": "Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your bodyâ€™s natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It:\n\nRecognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria.\nProduces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease.\nRemembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.\n\nThe vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness."
